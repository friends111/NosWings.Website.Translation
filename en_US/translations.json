It started in November 2016 and we decided to close in January 2018 because we were not satisfied by OpenNos' possibilities to add new features in the game. Then everyone left NosWings, doing their own project on their side to learn a lot of technical new things. 1 year, 6 months later, Blowa decided to reopen the NosWings project, he conctacted old NosWings members to make a new adventure with much more possibilities."
