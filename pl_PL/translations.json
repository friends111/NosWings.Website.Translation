The ItemShop will also include random boxes with random stuff in it, like SP Upgrade Box containing FMs, WoAs, scrolls and souls. All these boxes would also be obtainable through in-game grinding or some other means. Same goes for VIP status that gives free NosBazaar or inventory perks and more comfort oriented advantages."

It started in November 2016 and we decided to close in January 2018 because we were not satisfied by OpenNos' possibilities to add new features in the game. Then everyone left NosWings, doing their own project on their side to learn a lot of technical new things. 1 year, 6 months later, Blowa decided to reopen the NosWings project, he conctacted old NosWings members to make a new adventure with much more possibilities."
